# BLAST-PROJECT

## **Member :**

The objective of this project is to develop a program to enrich blast data and facilitate bioinformaticians to process them.

## **❗ Important**

To be able to compile this program, you have to be on Linux or MacOS operating system. 

* If you are on Window, you can install WSL by following this [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
* You need the taxonomy.dat file.

> The libxml library and unicode library are included in the project. 

## Resume 

The blast-project contains two programs : 
- BALLAST : Blast Post-Processing based on locally conserved segments.

This program was developed in 2000's by Julie Thompson, Olivier Poch and Frederic Plewniak in C language. The goal is to  predict local maximum segments from a single Blast database search and to highlight these divergent homologues.
